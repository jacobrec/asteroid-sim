# Asteroids Simulator
*Created by Jacob Reckhard and Kyle Hennig*

## Program Requirements

### Part 1
- You must visualize and simulate a variable size asteroid field
- When asteroids collide, they must break apart into smaller asteroids, whilst maintaining their original momentum
- There must be a method for changing the number of asteroids in the simulation
### Part 2
- The shuttle must be able to fly anywhere in the asteroid field and avoid the asteroids for as long as possible

## Rubric

### Program Design GUI
- [x] Screen size of application: Does the program use the full screen size? /5
- [ ] Interface and usage: Does the program use a simple interface? Is it easy to use? /15
- [ ] Display: Do the asteroid and shuttle sizes seem appropriate? Do they accurately represent their real counterparts? /15
- [ ] Code Readability: Is the program coded in a systematic manner? Using appropriate architecture? /8
- [ ] Is there a sufficient amount of comments? /2

### Documentation
- [x] Is there an accompanying README? /3

### Solution Performance
- [ ] Complete Solution: Does the program meet the requirements described in the problem? /5
- [ ] Part A: Do asteroids break apart when they collide? /5
- [ ] Can you vary the number of asteroids currently being displayed? /5
- [ ] Are asteroids recreated when others leave the screen? /2
- [ ] Part B: Is the shuttle able to navigate through the simulation? /5
- [ ] Does the shuttle avoid asteroids for a suitable period of time? /5
- [ ] Does the program offer above and beyond features? /10
- [ ] Performance: Does the simulation scale well when more asteroids are added? (Slowdown isnâ€™t too extreme) /5
- [ ] Bugs: Are there any reported bugs/issues? /-15 (-5 per bug)
- [ ] Are there any un-reported bugs/issues? /-50 (-25 per bug)

### Presentation and Management
- [ ] Content: Was the presentation clear and understandable? /5
- [ ] Was the code well explained during the presentation? /5
- [ ] Professionalism: Did the team appear professional? Were all team members available? /3
- [ ] Was the team communication clear? Such as: proper use of jargon, not extremely technical? /2
- [ ] Presentation: Was the presentation interesting? Easy to follow? /5
